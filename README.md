# KazBot
Maybe this will become a crypto-coin trading bot using gdax exchange

Developed using python 3.6.5

Required:
iso8601
gdax

Short term goals
- make tests use unittest -> create test readme -> create test suite?
- finish backtest
- add backtest test
- add links to required libs. Also mention pip install annoyance (OSX only) when installing gdax.
- Maybe look into that project tab on github...
- come up with more short term goals :-P
